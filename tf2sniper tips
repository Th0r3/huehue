okay so first i would suggest that you change your fov and make your viewmodels smalller, to do that you have to go into your steam folder.

Steam > SteamApps > common > Team Fortress 2 > tf > cfg 

once there you have to open the file "autoexec.cfg". If it's not there just create it.
(Right-Click in any free space of the Folder > New > New textdocument and name it "autoexec.cfg") 
And then you paste this into the (new) document: 
fov_desired 90
viewmodel_fov 70
tf_use_min_viewmodels 1
cl_interp 0.0325
cl_interp_ratio 1
rate 97000
cl_updaterate 66
cl_cmdrate 66

This just gives an overall better experience and makes you see more things going on around you. Now off to the Sniper tips.

Since i found a pretty good guide for this on the internet i dont really have to type much here.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128632408

Some of the weapon descriptions there are outdated but the didnt change that much.
Everything after that is pretty much up to date and will probably help you at learning Sniper.
So basically important on that guide are the parts:

"Weapon Loadouts"
"What Sniper are you?"
"Lag Compensation and Hitbox"
"Sniper vs"
"Tips and Tricks"

And personally, i like to use the Basic Sniper Rifle and the Darwins Danger Shield.
For the melee weapon i use the Kurki or the Tribalman's Shiv
Only use the Bushwacka if you also have Jarate as secondary weapon equipped.

Thats basically it. Hope i could help you a little bit. :3
